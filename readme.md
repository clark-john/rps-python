# rps-python

An advanced **Python** console program. <br>
And you can also play with it.

## How to play:
To run this game, you can clone the repository by typing this in the command line: `git clone <this-repository>`

After cloning the repo, please run the **index.py** file first, otherwise it won't work. <br>
Now you choose between these options below:
<img src="/img/indexpy.PNG" /> <br>
**y/n** (yes or no) or **cmds** for special commands.

If you choose **y/n**: It will prompt you first to type the name of your AI/Computer player, you can type "***none***" to skip. And after typing the name, the game will start.

## What *Python* modules do you use?
These are the **Python** modules that I used:
+ os 
+ sys
+ configparser
+ random
+ datetime
+ matplotlib (this is required to be installed to display scoreboard)

#### Purposes of these modules?
+ os - checking if the *settings.ini* file exists
+ sys - to use the exit function
+ configparser - for making changes with the *settings.ini* file
+ random - randomizing actions
+ datetime - returning date and time
+ matplotlib - display scoreboard
